## Usage

### Starting a Game

To start a game, use the `/minigame start` command followed by the game name, world name, and player names. For example:

### Survival Games Creator Mode

The Survival Games creator mode allows server administrators to set up spawn points for players in a specific world. This mode is essential for preparing the game environment before starting a match. To enter the creator mode, use the command `/minigame setup survivalgames <world>`.

Once in creator mode, you can set spawn points by right-clicking blocks with a stick. Each right-click will register the location as a spawn point for the specified world. The plugin will store these locations and use them to teleport players when the game starts.

To exit the creator mode, simply stop interacting with the blocks or use any other command. The spawn points will be saved and can be used in future matches. This setup ensures that all players have designated starting positions, making the game fair and organized.
