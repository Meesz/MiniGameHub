### Core Functionality

1.  **Timer Handling**

    -   Random timer intervals for swaps (configurable).
    -   Countdown display for players.
    -   Notification to players before swap (e.g., "Swapping in 5 seconds").
2.  **Player Swap Mechanics**

    -   Safe swapping to ensure players don't get stuck in blocks or instantly die.
    -   Teleportation with location preservation (including pitch and yaw).
3.  **Player Death Handling**

    -   Detecting player deaths.
    -   Respawn mechanics (instant respawn or spectator mode).
    -   Announcing deaths to all players.
4.  **Game Initialization and Termination**

    -   Command to start the game (`/deathswap start`).
    -   Command to stop the game (`/deathswap stop`).
    -   Configurable game settings (number of players, swap intervals).

### Gameplay Enhancements

1.  **Leaderboards**

    -   Tracking wins/losses for players.
    -   Displaying current standings in-game (e.g., via a scoreboard or chat command).
2.  **Player States**

    -   Handling joining and leaving players during the game.
    -   Managing player inventories (clearing on game start/end).
3.  **Spectator Mode**

    -   Allowing dead players to spectate ongoing games.
    -   Spectator teleportation to active players.
4.  **Chat Integration**

    -   Broadcast messages for major events (game start, player deaths, swaps).
    -   Private messages for individual player notifications.

### Configuration and Customization

1.  **Configurable Settings**

    -   Swap interval range (min and max times).
    -   Safe zones for teleportation (avoidance of dangerous locations).
    -   Game area boundaries (to restrict the play area).
2.  **Plugin Commands**

    -   Administrative commands (`/deathswap reload`, `/deathswap config`, etc.).
    -   Player commands for information (`/deathswap stats`, `/deathswap rules`).

### Technical Details

1.  **Data Persistence**

    -   Saving player stats and game settings to a file or database.
    -   Handling data loading on server start and saving on shutdown.
2.  **Error Handling**

    -   Logging for debugging purposes.
    -   Graceful handling of unexpected events (e.g., player disconnects).
3.  **Performance Optimization**

    -   Efficient teleportation to minimize server lag.
    -   Optimizing timer checks and event handling to reduce server load.

### User Experience

1.  **User Interface**

    -   GUI for settings and stats (if using a modded client or additional plugins).
    -   In-game item-based menu for easy access to commands.
2.  **Tutorial and Help**

    -   Command for help and rules (`/deathswap help`).
    -   In-game instructions for new players.

### Advanced Features

1.  **Team Support**

    -   Option to play in teams.
    -   Team-specific swaps and death handling.
2.  **Custom Events**

    -   Random events triggered at swap intervals (e.g., random effects, item drops).
3.  **Integration with Other Plugins**

    -   Compatibility with popular plugins (e.g., Essentials, Vault).
    -   Hooks for economy and permissions plugins.
4.  **Anti-Cheat Measures**

    -   Preventing exploitation of the swap mechanics.
    -   Ensuring fair play (e.g., preventing players from leaving during a swap).
